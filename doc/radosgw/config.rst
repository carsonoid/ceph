===========================
 Configuring RADOS Gateway
===========================

Before you can start RADOS Gateway, you must modify your ``ceph.conf`` file
to include a section for RADOS Gateway You must also create an ``rgw.conf`` 
file in the ``/etc/apache2/sites-enabled`` directory. The ``rgw.conf`` 
file configures Apache to interact with FastCGI.


Add a RADOS GW Configuration to ``ceph.conf``
=============================================

Add the RADOS Gateway configuration to your ``ceph.conf`` file.  The RADOS
Gateway configuration requires you to specify the host name where you installed
RADOS Gateway, a keyring (for use with cephx), the socket path and a log file. 
For example::  

	[client.radosgw.gateway]
		host = {host-name}
		keyring = /etc/ceph/keyring.radosgw.gateway
		rgw socket path = /tmp/radosgw.sock
		log file = /var/log/ceph/radosgw.log


Deploy ``ceph.conf``
====================

If you deploy Ceph with ``mkcephfs``, manually redeploy ``ceph.conf`` to the 
hosts in your cluster. For example:: 

	cd /etc/ceph
	ssh {host-name} sudo /etc/ceph/ceph.conf < ceph.conf


Create Data Directory
=====================

The ``mkcephfs`` deployment script may not create the default RGW data
directory.  Create data directories for each instance of a ``radosgw`` daemon (if
you haven't done so already). The ``host``  variables in the ``ceph.conf`` file
determine which host runs each instance of a ``radosgw`` daemon. The typical form
specifes the daemon ``radosgw``, the cluster name and the daemon ID. ::

	sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/ceph/radosgw/{$cluster}-{$id}

Using the exemplary ``ceph.conf`` settings above, you would execute the following::

	sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/ceph/radosgw/ceph-radosgw.gateway


Create ``rgw.conf``
===================

Create an ``rgw.conf`` file on the host where you installed RADOS Gateway
under the ``/etc/apache2/sites-available`` directory.

We recommend deploying FastCGI as an external server, because allowing
Apache to manage FastCGI sometimes introduces high latency. To manage FastCGI 
as an external server, use the ``FastCgiExternalServer`` directive. 
See `FastCgiExternalServer`_ for details on this directive. 
See `Module mod_fastcgi`_ for general details. :: 

	FastCgiExternalServer /var/www/s3gw.fcgi -socket /tmp/radosgw.sock

.. _Module mod_fastcgi: http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/25
.. _FastCgiExternalServer: http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/25#FastCgiExternalServer

Once you have configured FastCGI as an external server, you must 
create the virtual host configuration within your ``rgw.conf`` file. See 
`Apache Virtual Host documentation`_ for details on ``<VirtualHost>`` format 
and settings. Replace the values in brackets. ::

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerName {fqdn}
		ServerAdmin {email.address}
		DocumentRoot /var/www
	</VirtualHost>

.. _Apache Virtual Host documentation: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/

RADOS Gateway requires a rewrite rule for the Amazon S3-compatible interface. 
It's required for passing in the ``HTTP_AUTHORIZATION env`` for S3, which is 
filtered out by Apache. The rewrite rule is not necessary for the OpenStack 
Swift-compatible interface. Turn on the rewrite engine and add the following
rewrite rule to your Virtual Host configuration. :: 

	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^/([a-zA-Z0-9-_.]*)([/]?.*) /s3gw.fcgi?page=$1&params=$2&%{QUERY_STRING} [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization},L]
	
Since the ``<VirtualHost>`` is running ``mod_fastcgi.c``, you must include a
section in your ``<VirtualHost>`` configuration for the ``mod_fastcgi.c`` module. 

::

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		...
		<IfModule mod_fastcgi.c>
			<Directory /var/www>
				Options +ExecCGI
				AllowOverride All
				SetHandler fastcgi-script
				Order allow,deny
				Allow from all
				AuthBasicAuthoritative Off
			</Directory>
		</IfModule>
		...
	</VirtualHost>
	
See `<IfModule> Directive`_ for additional details. 

.. _<IfModule> Directive: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#ifmodule
	
Finally, you should configure Apache to allow encoded slashes, provide paths for
log files and to turn off server signatures. :: 	

	<VirtualHost *:80>	
	...	
		AllowEncodedSlashes On
		ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
		CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
		ServerSignature Off
	</VirtualHost>
	
.. important:: If you are using CentOS or similar, make sure that ``FastCgiWrapper`` is turned off in ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/fastcgi.conf``.

Enable the RADOS Gateway Configuration
======================================

Enable the site for ``rgw.conf``. :: 

	sudo a2ensite rgw.conf

Disable the default site. :: 

	sudo a2dissite default
	

Add a RADOS GW Script
=====================

Add a ``s3gw.fcgi`` file (use the same name referenced in the first line 
of ``rgw.conf``) to ``/var/www``. The contents of the file should include:: 

	#!/bin/sh
	exec /usr/bin/radosgw -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf -n client.radosgw.gateway
	
Ensure that you apply execute permissions to ``s3gw.fcgi``. ::

	sudo chmod +x s3gw.fcgi


Generate a Keyring and Key for RADOS Gateway
============================================

You must create a keyring for the RADOS Gateway. For example:: 

	sudo ceph-authtool --create-keyring /etc/ceph/keyring.radosgw.gateway
	sudo chmod +r /etc/ceph/keyring.radosgw.gateway
	
Generate a key so that RADOS Gateway can identify a user name and authenticate 
the user with the cluster. Then, add capabilities to the key. For example:: 

	sudo ceph-authtool /etc/ceph/keyring.radosgw.gateway -n client.radosgw.gateway --gen-key
	sudo ceph-authtool -n client.radosgw.gateway --cap osd 'allow rwx' --cap mon 'allow r' /etc/ceph/keyring.radosgw.gateway
	

Add to Ceph Keyring Entries 
===========================

Once you have created a keyring and key for RADOS GW, add it as an entry in
the Ceph keyring. For example::

	sudo ceph -k /etc/ceph/ceph.keyring auth add client.radosgw.gateway -i /etc/ceph/keyring.radosgw.gateway
	

Restart Services and Start the RADOS Gateway
============================================

To ensure that all components have reloaded their configurations, 
we recommend restarting your ``ceph`` and ``apaches`` services. Then, 
start up the ``radosgw`` service. For example:: 

	sudo service ceph restart
	sudo service apache2 restart
	sudo /etc/init.d/radosgw start


Create a RADOS Gateway User
===========================

To use the REST interfaces, first create an initial RADOS Gateway user. 
The RADOS Gateway user is not the same user as the ``client.rados.gateway``
user, which identifies the RADOS Gateway as a user of the RADOS cluster.
The RADOS Gateway user is a user of the RADOS Gateway. ::

	sudo radosgw-admin user create --uid="{username}" --display-name="{Display Name}"

For example:: 	
	
  radosgw-admin user create --uid=johndoe --display-name="John Doe" --email=john@example.com
  
.. code-block:: javascript
  
  { "user_id": "johndoe",
    "rados_uid": 0,
    "display_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "suspended": 0,
    "subusers": [],
    "keys": [
      { "user": "johndoe",
        "access_key": "QFAMEDSJP5DEKJO0DDXY",
        "secret_key": "iaSFLDVvDdQt6lkNzHyW4fPLZugBAI1g17LO0+87"}],
    "swift_keys": []}

Creating a user also creates an ``access_key`` and
``secret_key`` entry for use with any S3 API-compatible client.	
For details on RADOS Gateway administration, see `radosgw-admin`_. 

.. _radosgw-admin: ../../man/8/radosgw-admin/ 

.. important:: Check the key output. Sometimes ``radosgw-admin``
   generates a key with an escape (``\``) character, and some clients
   do not know how to handle escape characters. Remedies include 
   removing the escape character (``\``), encapsulating the string
   in quotes, or simply regenerating the key and ensuring that it 
   does not have an escape character.

Configuring the Operations Logging
==================================

By default, the RADOS Gateway will log every successful operation in the RADOS backend.
This means that every request, whether it is a read request or a write request will
generate a RADOS operation that writes data. This does not come without cost, and may
affect overall performance. Turning off logging completely can be done by adding the
following config option to ceph.conf::

        rgw enable ops log = false

Another way to reduce the logging load is to send operations logging data to a unix domain
socket, instead of writing it to the RADOS backend::

        rgw ops log rados = false
        rgw enable ops log = true
        rgw ops log socket path = <path to socket>

When specifying a unix domain socket, it is also possible to specify the maximum amount
of memory that will be used to keep the data backlog::

        rgw ops log data backlog = <size in bytes>

Any backlogged data in excess to the specified size will be lost, so socket needs to be
constantly read.

Enabling Swift Access
=====================

Allowing access to the object store with Swift (OpenStack Object
Storage) compatible clients requires an additional step, the creation
of a subuser and a Swift access key.

::

  sudo radosgw-admin subuser create --uid=johndoe --subuser=johndoe:swift --access=full

.. code-block:: javascript

  { "user_id": "johndoe",
    "rados_uid": 0,
    "display_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "suspended": 0,
    "subusers": [
      { "id": "johndoe:swift",
        "permissions": "full-control"}],
    "keys": [
      { "user": "johndoe",
        "access_key": "QFAMEDSJP5DEKJO0DDXY",
        "secret_key": "iaSFLDVvDdQt6lkNzHyW4fPLZugBAI1g17LO0+87"}],
    "swift_keys": []}

::

  sudo radosgw-admin key create --subuser=johndoe:swift --key-type=swift

.. code-block:: javascript

  { "user_id": "johndoe",
    "rados_uid": 0,
    "display_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "suspended": 0,
    "subusers": [
       { "id": "johndoe:swift",
         "permissions": "full-control"}],
    "keys": [
      { "user": "johndoe",
        "access_key": "QFAMEDSJP5DEKJO0DDXY",
        "secret_key": "iaSFLDVvDdQt6lkNzHyW4fPLZugBAI1g17LO0+87"}],
    "swift_keys": [
      { "user": "johndoe:swift",
        "secret_key": "E9T2rUZNu2gxUjcwUBO8n\/Ev4KX6\/GprEuH4qhu1"}]}

This step enables you to use any Swift client to connect to and use RADOS
Gateway via the Swift-compatible API. As an example, you might use the ``swift``
command-line client utility that ships with the OpenStack Object Storage
packages.

::

  swift -V 1.0 -A http://radosgw.example.com/auth -U johndoe:swift -K E9T2rUZNu2gxUjcwUBO8n\/Ev4KX6\/GprEuH4qhu1 post test  
  swift -V 1.0 -A http://radosgw.example.com/auth -U johndoe:swift -K E9T2rUZNu2gxUjcwUBO8n\/Ev4KX6\/GprEuH4qhu1 upload test myfile

RGW's ``user:subuser`` tuple maps to the ``tenant:user`` tuple expected by Swift.

.. important:: RGW's Swift authentication service only supports
   built-in Swift authentication (``-V 1.0``) at this point. There is
   currently no way to make RGW authenticate users via OpenStack
   Identity Service (Keystone).

Integrating with OpenStack Keystone
===================================

It is possible to integrate RGW with Keystone, the OpenStack identity service.
This sets up RGW to accept Keystone as the users authority. A user that Keystone
authorizes to access RGW will also be automatically created on RGW (if didn't
exist beforehand). A token that Keystone validates will be considered as valid
by RGW.

The following config options are available for Keystone integration::

	[client.radosgw.gateway]
		rgw keystone url = {keystone server url}
		rgw keystone admin token = {keystone admin token}
		rgw keystone accepted roles = {accepted user roles}
		rgw keystone token cache size = {number of tokens to cache}
		rgw keystone revocation interval = {number of seconds before checking revoked tickets}
		nss db path = {path to nss db}

An RGW user is mapped into a Keystone ``tenant``. A Keystone user has different
roles assigned to it on possibly more than a single tenant. When RGW gets the
ticket, it looks at the tenant, and the user roles that are assigned to that
ticket, and accepts/rejects the request according to the ``rgw keystone accepted
roles`` configurable.

Keystone itself needs to be configured to point to RGW as an object-storage
endpoint::

	keystone service-create --name swift --type-object-store
	keystone endpoint-create --service-id <id> --public-url http://radosgw.example.com/swift/v1


The keystone url is the Keystone admin RESTful api url. The admin token is the
token that is configured internally in Keystone for admin requests.

RGW will query Keystone periodically for a list of revoked tokens. These
requests are encoded and signed. Also, Keystone may be configured to provide
self signed tokens, which are also encoded and signed. RGW needs to be able to
decode and verify these signed messages, and it requires it to be set up
appropriately. Currently, RGW will be able to do it only if it was compiled with
``--with-nss``. It also requires converting the OpenSSL certificates that
Keystone uses for creating the requests to the nss db format, for example::

	mkdir /var/ceph/nss

	openssl x509 -in /etc/keystone/ssl/certs/ca.pem -pubkey | \
		certutil -d /var/ceph/nss -A -n ca -t "TCu,Cu,Tuw"
	openssl x509 -in /etc/keystone/ssl/certs/signing_cert.pem -pubkey | \
		certutil -d /var/ceph/nss -A -n signing_cert -t "TCu,Cu,Tuw"


Enabling Subdomain S3 Calls
===========================

To use RADOS Gateway with subdomain S3 calls (e.g.,
``http://bucketname.hostname``), you must add the RADOS Gateway DNS name under
the ``[client.radosgw.gateway]`` section of your Ceph configuration file::

	[client.radosgw.gateway]
		...
		rgw dns name = {hostname}

You should also consider installing `Dnsmasq`_ on your client machine(s) when
using ``http://{bucketname}.{hostname}`` syntax. The  ``dnsmasq.conf`` file
should include the following settings:: 

	address=/{hostname}/{host-ip-address}
	listen-address={client-loopback-ip}

Then, add the ``{client-loopback-ip}`` IP address as the first DNS nameserver
on client the machine(s).
